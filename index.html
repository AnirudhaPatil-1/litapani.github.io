            Known for his dazzling charm, rapier wit, and unrivaled humility,
            Michael is the creator of the
            <a href="https://railstutorial.orn/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and
            the principal author of the
            <a href="https://learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous </a>
            introductory sequence. Michael is also notorious as the founder of
            <a href="https://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a> and the author of
            <a href="https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto"
              ><em>The Tau Manifesto</em></a
            >, but rumors that he's secretly a supervillian are slightly
            exaggerated.

            When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder

            designing interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some
            of the interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

            You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on
            Jimmy Kimmel , Conan , or Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a
            true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines
            of code from a tour bus as he is form his kitchen table.
