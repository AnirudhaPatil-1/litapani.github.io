I"`<p>Call me <em>Anirudha</em>. I’m a Mechnical Engineer with two years of expereince in Business Development Sector. For the past 3 years I have been preparing for the Engineering Services. Well I have cracked few prelims but haven’t been able to crack mains.
At present I am making a switch to IT field because I have always loved this field .</p>

<p>Well I love to read non-fiction books on subject like Psychology, History, Science and Biographies.</p>

<p>But I also like few poems that I like to read seldomly during the day like the following one .</p>

<p><strong>INVICTUS</strong><br />
 <em>by</em><br />
<em>William Ernest Henley</em></p>

<p>Out of the night that covers me,<br />
Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br />
I thank whatever gods may be<br />
For my unconquerable soul.</p>

<p>In the fell clutch of circumstance<br />
I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br />
Under the bludgeonings of chance<br />
My head is bloody, but unbowed.</p>

<p>Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br />
Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br />
And yet the menace of the years<br />
Finds and shall find me unafraid.</p>

<p>It matters not how strait the gate,<br />
How charged with punishments the scroll,<br />
I am the master of my fate,<br />
I am the captain of my soul.</p>
