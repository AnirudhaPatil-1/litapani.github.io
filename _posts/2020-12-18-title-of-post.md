Call me _Anirudha_. I'm a Mechnical Engineer with two years of expereince in Business Development Sector. For the past 3 years I have been preparing for the Engineering Services. Well I have cracked few prelims but haven't been able to crack mains.
At present I am making a switch to IT field because I have always loved this field .

Well I love to read non-fiction books on subject like Psychology, History, Science and Biographies.

But I also like few poems that I like to read seldomly during the day like the following one .

**INVICTUS**  
 _by_  
_William Ernest Henley_

Out of the night that covers me,  
Black as the pit from pole to pole,  
I thank whatever gods may be  
For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance  
I have not winced nor cried aloud.  
Under the bludgeonings of chance  
My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears  
Looms but the Horror of the shade,  
And yet the menace of the years  
Finds and shall find me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,  
How charged with punishments the scroll,  
I am the master of my fate,  
I am the captain of my soul.
